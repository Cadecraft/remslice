# remslice üçä

A personal, ergonomic CLI assistant for my miscellaneous needs

This project is currently in development and not all features are implemented;
please keep in mind that this is purely intended for my own personal and productivity usecases.

## Installation

To build remslice, Cargo must be installed. This is a cross-platform application.

There is also the dependency of `cli-clipboard` for the copy feature:
- On Windows and macOS, this should work without any additional installation.
- On Linux, according to crates.io, `xorg-dev` and `libxcb-composite0-dev` must first be installed.

In the directory, run `cargo build` or `cargo install --path .` for this project.

It is recommended to add the generated executable to the PATH variable or put it in your bin
for global easy access on the command line.

## Config

Use `remfetch` to see the directory where your `.remrc` file should be placed (it should be your home directory).
This file is where all configuration goes.
Follow this syntax in the `.remrc` file:

- Use the hash (`#`) symbol to start a comment line
```
# This is a comment
```

- `tip` creates a new tip with the given nickname that links to the given file path
```
tip tipname C:/MyFolder/thing.txt
tip anothertip C:/Other/Path/anotherthing.txt
```

- `todo` defines the path used by the todo features (ex. the `tda` command)
```
todo C:/MyFolder/todos_list.md
```

- Because file paths come as the last argument, spaces in them *are* allowed naturally; do not use quotes around paths. This also means spaces *cannot* be used in tip nicknames; consider underscores or dashes. Capitalization is allowed and preserved.

<!-- TODO: if ever published publicly, change the example config to be less personal -->

Example config:
```
# remrc for personal PC
# R: v0.2.0, E: 2024/08/09

# Tips: these are used to easily see the contents of frequently accessed text documents
tip vimtoremember C:/Cade/PDFs/Utility/ToRememberDocs/VimToRemember.md
tip shortcutstoremember C:/Cade/PDFs/Utility/ToRememberDocs/ShortcutsToRemember.md
tip testtodos C:/Cade/Java/testtodos.txt
tip commandstoremember C:/Cade/PDFs/Utility/ToRememberDocs/CommandsToRemember.md
tip help C:/Cade/Rust/Misc/remslice/README.md
tip todos C:/Cade/Favorites/Todos/todos_ShortTermSync2.md
# TODO: add class schedules and other useful files

# Todo path
todo C:/Cade/Favorites/Todos/todos_ShortTermSync2.md
```

## System Commands
- `exit`/`quit`/`q` - exit immediately
- `version`/`ver` - display simple version information
- `remfetch` - aesthetically display more version information (think neofetch)
- `pwd` - display the current working directory
- `help` - display a simple help screen that points to this README file (if you use this often, consider adding a tip)

## Misc. Commands
- `bye` - exit with a farewell message
- `ping` - pong!
- `wipe` - wipe the screen
- `time` - display the current time
- `copy`/`y` - copy ("yank") the last copyable message sent to the system clipboard (generally used after `score`)
- `paste`/`p` - display the contents of the system clipboard
- `pasterun!`/`pr!` - run the contents of the system clipboard as a command input to rem (dangerous--`paste` first to see contents!)

<!-- TODO: list all if still unfinished -->

## Procedure/Action Commands
- `score` - generate a daily score based on input prompts
- `tip {nickname}` - load a file based on its defined nickname (searches for the first one starting with the argument) (note: `b` is synonymous with `tip`)
- `tip {nickname} {grep prompt}` - load a file like above, but automatically call the `grep` command below on it
- `tip-ls` - list all available tips and their file paths
- `grep` - search through the currently loaded file for lines containing a specific term (case-insensitive; instantly displays)
- `line {line number}` - print the given line of the currently loaded file
- `tda` - "todo append": add an entry into the todo file specified in `remrc.txt` (entries are automatically markdown bulleted with a dash)
- `tdt` - "todo top": display the top (most recent) entries in the todo file specified in `remrc.txt` (up until the most recent `#` header); display lowercase alphabetical IDs alongside each entry
- `tdt2` - "todo top x2": display the top todo entries (up until the 2nd most recent `##` header)

<!-- TODO: tdc ("todo clear") and a system of letters/numbers/hex (?) for ID'ing all listed todos -->

## More

This was developed using the `rebelot/kanagawa.nvim` theme.

Todo files are expected to be in markdown, formatted like this:
```md
# Todo List
## 2024/08/08
- build a project
- ~~this one has been completed~~
## 2024/08/09
- keep building
- take notes
```

## Etymology?

*Rem is easily forgotten;*

*this program takes utilitarian slices of everyday tools and systems to make remembering things easier,*

*creating a clean and lightweight feel, like an orange slice*
